# redux-shop-project
This is my first redux project

This is a project I learned from Udemy, all the css files were provided by my instructor since the beginnning. 
I use redux toolkit to store function that fetch item from firebase(database), send cart amount, change amount of the items, etc.
However, my firebase is not working, so you have to replace mine with yours. 

Nevertheless, the user will be able to select item he or she wants and add more or remove item in the cart.
